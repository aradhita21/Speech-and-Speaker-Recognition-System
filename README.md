# Speech-and-Speaker-Recognition-System

The main motivation for this project is to implement voice fingerprinting, a biometric way of identification, along with recognizing the word said. 
This project is oriented towards learning the algorithm of speech and voice recognition.

three steps:

Feature extraction, 
Data preprocessing, 
deep neural network model and gaussian mixture model.
